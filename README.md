# Stock_Search_Android_App

This Android app works similar to commercial stock trading apps with the exception that it doesn't have real money and doesn't buy actual stocks. It is loaded with $20,000 dummy money using which you can use to practice buying and selling dummy stocks before you invest actual money. All values and charts related to the stocks of different companies are updated real-time and are actual values which are obtained every 15 seconds from the web using various APIs.
